# The Philosophy
FastCode is meant to be a simple-to-use yet, portable, and fast programming language that only uses a minimal amount of computing resources. It's best suited for usage as an extension language as well as a general purpose language. 

# The Rationale
FastCode grabs the best features of Python, Java, and C and leaves the worst out while adhering to to it's philosophy.
## Python

# Some Examples
```
proc range(n) {
  range = array(n)
  while n-- {
    range[n] = n
  }
  return range
}

rem fizzbuzz from 0 to 99
for i in range(100) {
  print(i)
  if i % 5 == 0 {
    print("fizz")
  }
  if i % 3 == 0 {
    print("buzz")
  }
}
```
